SCHMEA just means --> the shape of the data. Basically, what does the DB look like. Rows, tables, constraints 

To create our .db3 file, all we do is go to sqlite studio, open a database, click the green + button, enter our data file, and name a new DB file, then save. 

Migration files --> representation of changes we want to make to the DB schema. a snapshot of what our schema looks like..
